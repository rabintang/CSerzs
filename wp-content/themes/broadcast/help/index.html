		<h3 id="Installation"><strong>A) Theme Installation</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>
		<p>Extract the files from the zip folder. There should be a folder called "Broadcast" upload this to your themes folder via <b>FTP</b>. The next step is to activate the theme. You will login into your admin panel. Appearance &raquo; Themes &raquo; Broadcast click the activate link.  
        <br />If you need help selecting a ftp. I use <a href="http://filezilla-project.org/" target="_blank">FileZilla</a>.</p>
		
<hr>

		<h3 id="Creatingposts"><strong>B) Creating Posts</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>

		<p>I'm going to assume you know how to create a post in wordpress admin panel if not to create a post in wordpress first login into the admin panel &raquo; Posts &raquo; Add New. Ok, After you type in your title and post content. You'll want to add a image so it displays in the featured slider. The way to do this is to set a featured image. </p> 
       <ol><li><strong>First Step (Click "Set featured image") Located on the right side of the panel.</strong></li>
        
       <li><strong>Second Step (Click select files and select a image for your featured image.) </strong></li>
        
       <li><strong>Third And Final (After upload is done scroll down and click "Use as featured image") </strong></li></ol>
        
        <p>I strongly recommend you use a image the size of 438 X 332 or bigger. For better resolution in the featured slider.</p>

         <li><p><b>My images aren't working.</b> - If your images aren't working make sure to chmod the files "thumb.php" and the folder "cache" to either 777 or 755.</p></li>

         

         <li>
           <p><b>My slider doesn't work.</b> - A lot of users just upload the complete zip file they downloaded from ThemeForest. 



But the actual way to upload is to open the zip file you downloaded from ThemeForest.

And only upload the zip file "Broadcast.zip" or upload the "Broadcast" folder found inside the file you downloaded from ThemeForest.



<b>Do not upload all the contents of the zip file you downloaded from themeforest this will only result in javascript errors.</b> If this does not work for you. Then it's a plugin causing the problems you'll have to disable each plugin and re-activate one by one to see which one is causing the problems.

</p></li>

         

         </ul>

		<p>Once again, thank you so much for purchasing this theme. As I said at the beginning, I'd be glad to help you if you have any questions relating to this theme. No guarantees, but I'll do my best to assist. If you have a more general question relating to the themes on ThemeForest, you might consider visiting the forums and asking your question in the "Item Discussion" section.</p>
